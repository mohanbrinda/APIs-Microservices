Managing Packages with Npm - How to Use package.json, the Core of Any Node.js Project or npm Package

Introduction
The Node Package Manager (npm) is a command-line tool used by developers in order to control and share packages or modules of JavaScript code written for use with Node.js.

Npm generates a package.json file which lists the dependencies for the project, whenever a new project is started. Npm packages are regularly updated and changes can be done to the package.json file to set specific version numbers for each dependency. This ensures that updates to a package don't break your project.

npm saves packages in a folder named node_modules. These packages can be installed in two ways:

globally in a root node_modules folder in order to be accessible by all projects.
locally within a project's own node_modules folder, accessible only to that project.

In order to create a separation between the dependencies of different projects, developers prefer to install packages local to each project.

Each challenge has been completed in Glitch, a starter project and and the public Glitch url has been copied to free code camp challenge screen in order to test it.

The following project have been completed Glitch tool.
